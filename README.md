# Edit images GUI 
This project presents a user-friendly Image Processing GUI application that allows users to apply various image  filters and enhancements using Python. The system leverages OpenCV, Tkinter, and customtkinter to provide a  responsive and modern interface.

I use Anaconda to make an environment on my PC with all the libraries.
